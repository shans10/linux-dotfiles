All credit for this theme goes to [EliverLara](https://github.com/EliverLara) and his beautiful [firefox-sweet-theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/firefox-sweet-theme)!
I just modified the colors using gruvbox color palette from [morhetz/gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) vim theme and applied a few minor changes to the userchrome file.
